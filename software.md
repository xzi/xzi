# Favorite FOSS Software

This is a list of FOSS software that I use and personally recommend. The use cases for all of these vary as I do a lot of things on my machine. I will try to give a short explanation of what everything does however. Everything on this list will work on a semi-sane Arch Linux. This list will be expanded with time.

## Prism Launcher

[Website](https://prismlauncher.org/)  
[Repo](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher)  

Prism Launcher is an alternative Minecraft launcher with multi-instance support. This means that your latest version vanilla install is seperate from your modded install which is seperate from your beta install. It is a very flexible launcher that solves the primary issue with the vanilla launcher (other than not having proper Linux support).

## mpv

[Website](https://mpv.io/)  
[Repo](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)  

mpv is an incredibly optimized video player. To quote their website, "[mpv] supports a wide variety of media file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types." It also supports scripting and GPU decoding with a minimalist UI. I personally use it for all my local video watching.

## Mumble

[Website](https://www.mumble.info/)  
[Repo](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble)  

Mumble is a customizable and self-hosted voice chat software that allows users to run their own private voice chats for their friends or group use. My EVE Online corp personally uses Mumble for our voice coms and I have fallen in love with the software ever since. While it does lack things such as screenshare, that personally is not a deal breaker for me and I recommend it regardless.

## cobalt.tools

[Website](https://cobalt.tools/)  
[Repo](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt)  

cobalt.tools is an online media downloader that supports a bunch of websites and has a pretty good privacy policy. While I prefer yt-dlp over it, cobalt is still what I recommend to most people who are trying to download videos.

## Catnip

[Repo](https://github.com/iinsertNameHere/catnip)  

Catnip is a fetch program written in Nim. Not much to say here we all know what a fetch program is. If you don't then you clearly haven't been around the Linux ricing community that much. You should stop by. We don't bite :).

## OBS Studio

[Website](https://obsproject.com/)  
[Repo](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio)  

OBS Studio is the best free video recording software. Period. Nothing even touches OBS in terms of quality. I have never had an issue with it. If you need an extremely flexible, free recording software for whatever you are doing, use OBS.

## Kleopatra

[Website](https://apps.kde.org/kleopatra/)  
[Repo](https://invent.kde.org/pim/kleopatra)

Kleopatra is a front end for dealing with PGP keys and various forms of encryption related to that. It's a KDE app and generally works pretty well from my experience. I don't use PGP too much, but when I do I always use Kleopatra to do it since it makes the process a lot less tedious.

## Doukutsu-rs

[Website](https://doukutsu-rs.github.io/)
[Repo](https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs)

Doukutsu-rs is "a fully playable re-implementation of the Cave Story (Doukutsu Monogatari) engine written in Rust." It fixes a lot of bugs with the base game, adds some content/features from the non-PC ports of the game, and adds a ton of customization options. It works perfectly with the freeware port of Cave Story and I highly recommend it as a way to experience the game if you haven't played it yet (seriously, [play Cave Story](https://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php)).
