# Favorite FOSS Software

This is a list of FOSS software that I use and personally recommend. The use cases for all of these vary as I do a lot of things on my machine. I will try to give a short explanation of what everything does however. Everything on this list will work on a semi-sane Arch Linux. 

## Prism Launcher
[Website](https://prismlauncher.org/)  
[Repo](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher)  

Prism Launcher is an alternative Minecraft launcher with multi-instance support. This means that your latest version vanilla install is seperate from your modded install which is seperate from your beta install. It is a very flexible launcher that solves the primary issue with the vanilla launcher (other than not having proper Linux support).

## mpv
[Website](https://mpv.io/)  
[Repo](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)  

mpv is an incredibly optimized video player. To quote their website, "[mpv] supports a wide variety of media file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types." It also supports scripting and GPU decoding with a minimalist UI. I personally use it for all my local video watching. 

## Mumble
[Website](https://www.mumble.info/)  
[Repo](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble)  

Mumble is a customizable and self-hosted voice chat software that allows users to run their own private voice chats for their friends or group use. My EVE Online corp personally uses Mumble for our voice coms and I have fallen in love with the software ever since. While it does lack things such as screenshare, that personally is not a deal breaker for me and I recommend it regardless.
