# To-do List

This is just a public to-do list for a bunch of miscellaneous things I am planning on doing at some point.  

[ ] Website rewrite
[ ] Create a complete list of all the atrocities commited by KAIST (I'm never going to college am I)
[ ] Update the mpv config
[ ] Create a general dotfiles repo
[ ] Make something useful for someone other than myself
