# To-do List

This is just a public to-do list for a bunch of miscellaneous things I am planning on doing at some point.  

- [ ] Website rewrite ([Repo](https://github.com/xzi/website/tree/dev))
- [ ] Create a complete list of all the atrocities commited by KAIST (I'm never going to college am I) (Repo TBD)
- [ ] Update the mpv config (Repo TBD, recreating it)
- [ ] Create a general dotfiles repo (Repo TBD)
- [ ] Make something useful for someone other than myself
